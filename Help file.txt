Hello Wanderer! We are so glad that you've come to help us reclaim our prison! An uprising has happened and we need help to get it back!
There's four cells you need to clear to rid our prison of these meanies! However! The meanie's boss Harambe, has a lock on his cell and you need to beat all
other meanies before you can get into his cell. After you have, hit ESC on your keyboard to teleport to his room! Travel through each room and beat each of the meanies in each room! Each meanie have a weapon they're keeping in their pockets
however, they are so uneducated that they cannot use them.You can use these yourself once you beat the meanies. Be careful though! Harambe will know which
weapon you're using when you walk in and will adjust his attack patterns accordingly! Without further ado, good luck! We have equipped you with a sword for your adventure!
Just remember! We have a sack of gold with your name on it after you get rid of Harambe and his meanies! Excelsior!
